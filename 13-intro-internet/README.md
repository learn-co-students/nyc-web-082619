- CRUD is an acronym that stands for ****\_\_\_\_****, **\_\_**, **\_**, & **\_\_**

- **\_** is an interface that allows us to create web applications in Ruby. It was initially used to make static webpages.

- The client sends a packet of information called a **\_** to the server which in turn sends back another packet of information called a **\_\_**.

- **\_\_**s are methods that communicate to the server which CRUD action we want to execute

- When we enter a URL into our web browser it sends a **\_\_** request to the server

- The **\_\_** and **\_\_** keys in the request headers are what tells our application which method to invoke

- When a method is invoked after an HTTP request it must respond with **\_\_\_** that details the markup for the webpage that the user sees.
