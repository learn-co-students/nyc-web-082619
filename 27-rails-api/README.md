Rails API
===========

## SWBATs
- [ ] Create an API using Rails
- [ ] Render JSON formatted data
- [ ] Use namespacing to version control an API
- [ ] Use serializers to control internal structure of JSON data
- [ ] Use `fetch` in JS to communicate to an API
- [ ] Coordinate data on the frontend with data on the backend
- [ ] Synthesize knowledge of DOM manipulation, event listeners, and asynchronous JS with Rails concepts

## Notes


### Objectives

### Getting started

`rails new <app_name> --api`

The `--api` flag tells Rails to build itself for use as an API, making it more lightweight, and setting up initializers that will allow communication between servers.

### Serializers

#### Active Model Serializers
- Slow
- No longer well supported
- Gets the job done

#### Fast JSON Serializer
- Super fast
- Made by Netflix
