====================

## SWBAT

- [ ] Write cleaner React code

## Objectives

- Opinions
  - [x] Code Organization/file structure 
  - [x] Presentational vs Container components

- Optimizations:
  - [x] Functional vs Class Components
  - [x] Fragments

- Best Practices:
  - [x] Functional setState
  - [x] "then" callback for setState
  - [x] Callbacks (avoid useless wrapping)

- JS tricks/bugs often seen in React:
  - [x] Arrow functions returning objects
  - [x] Destructuring
  - [x] Spread (w/ prepend and append)
  - [x] constructor vs. ES7 instance variables
  - [x] map (as a way to update objects in an array of objects)
  - [ ] { [variable]: "as_key" }
