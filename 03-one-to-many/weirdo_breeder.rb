# THE WEIRDO BREEDER

# The Weirdo Breeder wants to breed a bunch of dogs that can do the following stuff. 
# Below is a list of their requirements.
# How can we help them out?

# âˆš1. I want to be able to create a herd of dogs, each with a name and a breed
# âˆš2. I want every dog to be able to speak and tell me its name
# âˆš3. I want every dog to be able to run around
# âˆš4. I want every dog to be able to perform a trick where they speak, run around, and then rollover
# âˆš5. I want to be able to see a list of all of the dogs in my herd
# 6. I want to be able to find puppies in my herd by breed
# âˆš7. I want to be able to give my herd a single command and get them all to speak at the same time
