# Event Delegation

## SWBATs
- [x] Explain event propagation and identify how it can be used
- [x] Use conditional logic in combination with event propagation to delegate events
- [x] Use a single event handler callback to handle multiple events
- [ ] Use the `dataset` attribute to store data on specific DOM elements

## Notes

### Event preventDefault
- Stops the default behavior of that handler
  - For keyboard events, this is typing
  - For click events, this is clicking
  - For submit events, this is sending a POST request and refreshing the page

### Event Propagation
- Bubbling!
- When you trigger an event on a child, the event will bubble up to all ancestor elements and trigger event handlers of the same type on all ancestors (e.g. clicking on a child activates child's event click handler AS WELL as parent's click handler)
- `event.stopPropagation` stops the event from bubbling upwards

### Event Delegation
- The combination of conditional logic and event propagation to route events within a single event handler
- In other words, different DOM nodes can trigger different things

### Dataset
- A way to store information on HTML DOM nodes
- Used in a variety of ways, but principally used to store information about that particular node
- HTML must have attribute of `data-<key>="<value>"`
- Accessible on DOM nodes via `dataset` attribute as a object
